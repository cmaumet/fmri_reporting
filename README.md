# fmri_reporting
Easy best practice reporting for your fMRI study!

<!-- Outline the problem. Hard to share (meta)data => we don't. Benefits of sharing data. Help you do that.-->
<!-- So, you've performed your fMRI study and now you want to document what you've done. -->

There are more and more calls for transparency in the neuroimaging community. To maximise reuse, we would ideally share the analysis code, all the data and open the manuscript. But in practice this can prove to difficult and time consuming. Showing your working is a great way to advertise your work and build new collaborations. 

This course explores current solutions to share data and code in support of the publication of an fMRI study and provide simple receipes for different levels of data and code sharing.
