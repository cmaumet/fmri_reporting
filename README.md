Easy best practice reporting for your fMRI study!

<!-- So, you've performed your fMRI study and now you want to document what you've done. -->

Scientific communities are increasingly calling for more transparent research practices. Ideally, to maximise impact of our research, analysis code, data and manuscript should all be made available to the research community. But in practice, this can prove to difficult and time consuming.

This course explores current solutions to share data and code in support of the publication of an fMRI study and provides simple recipes for different levels of data and code sharing.
