This lesson is a template for creating lessons of the [easy fMRI reporting](https://github.com/easyreporting/fmri_reporting) project.

It is based on the lesson template used in [Neurohackweek]({{ site.nhw_site }}) and derived from [Data Carpentry]({{ site.dc_site }})
and [Software Carpentry]({{ site.swc_site }}) templates.
